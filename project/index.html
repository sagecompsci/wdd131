                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to Reid's Cat Adoption Shelter, where compassion meets paws. We are a nonprofit
                        organization based in the Cache Valley, devoted to the rescue, rehabilitation, and
                        re-homing of cats and kittens of all ages. Since opening our doors in 2011, we've helped
                        hundreds of cats find their forever homes, thanks to the support of our community and
                        our incredible team of volunteers.</p>

                        <p>Our center isn't just a shelter—it's a safe and loving environment where cats can heal,
                        socialize, and prepare for a better life. Whether they come to us from the streets,
                        owner surrenders, or overcrowded shelters, we believe every cat deserves a second chance.
                        We work closely with local veterinarians to ensure all our cats are spayed/neutered,
                        vaccinated, and given the medical attention they need before adoption.</p>

                        <p>At the heart of everything we do is our belief that love changes lives—both for the cats
                        we care for and the people who adopt them.</p>
